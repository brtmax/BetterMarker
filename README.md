# BetterMarker
We are two students that use iPads along with the Apple pencil to study almost every day. We use apps similar to GoodNotes to 
mark text with a textmarker tool. Just like using an actual textmarker on actual paper, you draw a line with the Apple pencil
on the part of the text that you wish to highlight. Since human input is always wobbly, the line has to be enhanced, which 
usually means to make it more straight. We often encounter the issue that we place the line either too high or too low, and 
thus the highlighted line does not cover all of the text (top to bottom), and things like the top of an "L" get cut off. 

Since it botheres us, we are trying to create a solution to this problem with BetterMarker.
